               <h3>Course description</h3>

               <p>COMP 126 provides a ground-up introduction to current principles, standards, and best practices in web
                  site
                  design, usability, accessibility, and general web development using HTML5, CSS3, very basic
                  JavaScript,
                  and
                  a selection of other tools and frameworks commonly used in contemporary web design and development.

               <p>Frain, Ben. Responsive Web Design with HTML5 & CSS. 3rd edition. Packt Publishing, 2020.
                  978-1-83921-156-0.</p>


               <p>Additional readings and texts will be made available as links and/or PDFs. If you have trouble with a
                  document or link, please let a member of the teaching staff know ASAP.</p>


                 <h3>Time & place</h3>

               <p>Unfortunately, I am somewhat immunocompromised, so I will need to keep in-person contact to a minimum
                  for
                  the time being. Currently, my plan is to hold one class session in person and one class session via
                  Zoom
                  each week. However, please be aware that if COVID cases on campus spike, I may need to shift to 100%
                  remote
                  instruction to protect my health, even if the University itself does not.</p>


               <p>(Note: I understand that some of you are only allowed to take a certain number of fully online courses
                  per
                  semester and that you weren't planning on this one adding to that total. If this is you, please don't
                  worry:
                  it won't change anything for you. Even if I need to go fully remote myself, the official in-person
                  status
                  of
                  the class will not change. It will not switch over to "fully online" status in Connect Carolina.)</p>


               <p>Most Tuesdays at 12:30: full-class lecture/discussion meetings on Zoom (link on Piazza site; class
                  recordings available at Sakai > Class Recordings)</p>

               <p>Most Thursdays at 12:30: Q&A/demo session in Sitterson Hall room 014 or on Zoom (link on Piazza site;
                  class recordings available at Sakai > Class Recordings)
               </p>

               <p>In-person meetings devoted to additional demos and walk-throughs, your questions and requests, and
                  extra
                  design and CSS instruction will be held in person in SN 014 most Thursdays, assuming it remains safe
                  to
                  do
                  so. Those who prefer to attend remotely may do so by Zooming in to the link above. Attendance will not
                  be taken, but it is strongly encouraged,
                  especially if you need extra help. </p>

               <p>All Zoom class meetings will be recorded and made available to you under Panopto on Sakai.</p>

                 <h3>Office hours</h3>

               <p>Tessa's office hours will be held on Zoom; see Piazza for the link.</p>

               <p>Contact me to schedule

               <br>
               <h3>Target audience</h3>

               <p>This course was designed to be useful in different ways to different students at different levels,
                  from
                  absolute beginners to more advanced programmers hoping to complement back-end web development skills
                  with
                  an
                  understanding of the front-end design and implementation process. It welcomes and equally prioritizes
                  the
                  goals of not only aspiring professional web developers but artists, entrepreneurs, librarians, digital
                  humanists, musicians, hobbyists, and everyone else. No prior technical expertise or programming
                  experience
                  is assumed or required.</p>


               <p>What this course covers: The fundamentals of modern HTML5 and CSS3; desktop and mobile layout and
                  design
                  principles; web accessibility standards; and an introduction to basic usability, UI (user interface
                  design),
                  and UX (user experience design).</p>


               <p>What this course does not cover: JavaScript (much); client-side or back-end programming; databases;
                  full-stack frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular.</p>


               <p>CS major/minors, experienced programmers, and all those with web development skills please note!: You
                  are
                  welcome to use this course as a place to sharpen your HTML and CSS skills and learn a few things about
                  design. However, please be aware that this is an HTML and CSS fundamentals course. It is not an
                  introduction
                  to the types of front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, etc.) that many of you will encounter in
                  industry.
                  And it does not count toward the major or minor in Computer Science.</p>


               <p>Once again, for emphasis: this course does not count toward the major BS, BA, or minor curriculum in
                  Computer Science.</p>


                 <h3>Goals & objectives</h3>

               <p>The primary goal of this course is to help students become competent advanced-beginner- to
                  intermediate-level web designers, independent learners, and capable problem solvers through a
                  project-based
                  approach to responsive web and UI design and development and its associated troubleshooting
                  strategies.
                  To
                  this end, our primary objectives and planned learning outcomes are as follows.</p>


               <p> By the end of this course, students will:</p>

               <ul class="syl-list">
                  <li class="syl-item">Possess an understanding of the basic and necessary processes and skills involved
                     in front-end responsive
                     web design and development;</li>
                  <li class="syl-item">Possess a working HTML5 and CSS3 skillset;</li>
                  <li class="syl-item">Understand and be able to employ modern UI design principles;</li>
                  <li class="syl-item">Possess the knowledge necessary to effectively pursue further formal or
                     self-motivated education in more
                     advanced web development tools and skills;</li>
                  <li class="syl-item">Have developed a well-designed, well-functioning live web site suitable for
                     inclusion in, or as, a
                     professional, artistic, and/or academic portfolio.</li>
               </ul>

                 <h3>Final project</h3>

               <p>In the COMP 126 final project, you'll form teams of 2-4 people and operate as a web design and
                  development
                  team hired to build a site for a client. I encourage you to find a “real” client for a “real” project
                  among
                  yourselves or in the community: an individual, group, club, company, whatever. The important thing is
                  to
                  have a way to define a client’s needs, goals, and priorities for the design and build of the site; why
                  not
                  offer your web development services to a group in need?</p>


                 <h3>Grading</h3>

               <p> Assignments: 25%</p>
               <p> Quizzes: 20%</p>
               <p> Final project: 20%</p>
               <p> Midterm: 15%</p>
               <p> Final exam: 20%</p>
               <p> Final grades will be converted to letter grades according to the following scale: 93-100: A; 90-92:
                  A-;
                  87-89: B+, 83-86: B, 80-82: B-; and so on. I do round up, but only and strictly at 0.51.</p>

                <h3>Software & tools</h3>

               <p>Text editor or IDE. You will need one. I recommend a lovely free editor called Visual Studio Code and
                  will
                  demo its setup for the benefit of beginners; more on that here:
                  <a href="setup.html" target="_blank">Text Editor Setup</a>.
               </p>
               <p>But you’re welcome to use the text editor of your choice.</p>

               <p>Codepen account. I’ll use Codepen for simple in-class demos and to share examples. Please create a
                  free
                  account at <a href="https://codepen.io/">https://codepen.io/</a>, if you don’t already have
                  one, and find and follow my account there
                  Search
                  for me by user: username tkjn.</p>
               <br>
               <h3>Quizzes, homework, & exams</h3>

               <p>Unless specified otherwise, homework and other short assignments will be scored on a 0-2 scale, as
                  follows:</p>

               <p>0: Hasn't been scored yet; wasn't completed and/or properly submitted in the first place; or the was
                  obviously completed with an exceptionally and unacceptably low level of effort, understanding, and/or
                  acquaintance with the readings/topics.</p>

               <p>1: Was completed on time but does not fully meet the requirements of the assignment. This usually
                  means
                  that
                  submission is thin, general, incomplete, and/or lacks specific reference to and engagement with the
                  course
                  materials and concepts.</p>
               <p>2: Completed on time, thoroughly, and in good faith, with evidence of effort and clear engagement with
                  the
                  assigned prompt, reading, viewing, question/s, and/or task/s.</p>


               <p>Quizzes will usually comprise 10 multiple-choice questions and be delivered on Sakai with a 30-minute
                  time limit, open book, open notes, open everything. (The professor reserves the right to alter this
                  format; notice will be given of any changes.) Quiz make-ups will only be granted when accompanied by a
                  University excused absence or when arranged and approved by the professor at least 24 hours in
                  advance. We do not drop a lowest quiz score.</p>


               <p>There will be a midterm exam and a final exam. The midterm will be half multiple-choice, half a
                  coding
                  exercise in which you'll be given an image of a website layout you must re-create using HTML and CSS
                  as
                  directed. The final exam will be multiple-choice only, since your final project—a fully developed,
                  live
                  website—is due at the same time and covers the coding aspect.</p>

               <p>The final exam will be administered in compliance with UNC's final exam regulations and scheduled
                  according
                  to the UNC Final Exam calendar.</p>

               <p>Quiz and midterm make-ups/reschedulings will only be granted when accompanied by a
                  University excused absence or when arranged and approved by the professor at least 24 hours in
                  advance. Final exam make-up/rescheduling requires a final exam excuse from the Dean's Office.</p>


               <br>
               <h3>Late assignments & extensions</h3>

               <p>In this class, we accept late assignments for credit (with 0.25 late penalty) for two weeks after
                  each
                  assignment's original due date, and only up until the last scheduled day of class.</p>

               <p>Requests for reasonable extensions will be considered when requested in advance—preferably 24 but at
                  least
                  12 hours before the assignment is due. However, for group projects, all group members must agree to
                  request
                  the extension and submit the request jointly.</p>

               <p>For late assignments that are part of the final project, an immediate penalty of three points (out of
                  100,
                  in the case of these assignments) will be applied as soon as the assignment is late, then another
                  point
                  for
                  every two hours thereafter.</p>

               <p>Quiz and midterm make-ups/reschedulings will only be granted when accompanied by a
                  University excused absence or when arranged and approved by the professor at least 24 hours in
                  advance. Final exam make-up/rescheduling requires a final exam excuse from the Dean's Office.</p>
               <br>
               <h3>Mask policy</h3>

               <p>As you know, there's a pandemic on, and University policy requires each of you to wear a mask
                  covering
                  the
                  mouth and nose in the classroom—a crucial step if we want to protect all the members of our community.
                  If
                  you choose to attend class without a mask or with a mask worn improperly, I will ask you to find a
                  mask
                  and
                  wear it according to CDC guidelines. If you choose not to do this, I will ask you to leave my
                  classroom.
                  I
                  will then submit a report to the Office of Student Conduct, which will result in your immediate
                  disenrollment from this course.</p>

               <p>Students who have an authorized accommodation from Accessibility Resources and Service are the only
                  exceptions to this policy. If you have such an accommodation, please make sure it is registered with

               <h3>Diversity, community, & support</h3>

               <p>I believe that each one of you—regardless of background, origin, race, ethnicity, nationality,
                  religion,
                  sexual orientation, gender identification, class, age, learning style, appearance, physical ability,
                  0r
                  anything else—deserves the opportunity to join a learning environment that is warm, respectful, and
                  welcoming of a diversity of voices and perspectives. I am committed to doing everything I can to
                  foster
                  such
                  an environment, which I consider my duty to you and our community, as well as my professional
                  obligation.
                  I
                  hope you will all work with me to accomplish this, and I welcome any suggestions you might have.</p>

               <p>Please read on for details about University resources and policies that support this commitment to
                  diversity
                  and inclusion.</p>

               <h3>Policy on non-discrimination</h3>

               <p> The University is committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment for all members of
                  our
                  community and to ensuring that educational and employment decisions are based on individuals’
                  abilities
                  and
                  qualifications. Consistent with this principle and applicable laws, the University’s Policy Statement
                  on
                  Non-Discrimination offers access to its educational programs and activities as well as employment
                  terms

                  information, disability, veteran’s status, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. 
                  Such a
                  policy ensures that only relevant factors are considered and that equitable and consistent standards
                  of
                  conduct and performance are applied.</p>

               <h3>Accessibility Resources & Services</h3>
               <p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill facilitates the implementation of reasonable
                  accommodations,
                  including resources and services, for students with disabilities, chronic medical conditions, a
                  temporary
                  disability or pregnancy complications resulting in barriers to fully accessing University courses,
                  programs
                  and activities.</p>

               <p>Accommodations are determined through the Office of Accessibility Resources and Service (ARS) for
                  individuals with documented qualifying disabilities in accordance with applicable state and federal
                  laws.
                  See the ARS Website for contact information: <a href="https://ars.unc.edu">https://ars.unc.edu</a> or

               <p>If you require any special accommodations to complete the work in this course, please make sure the
                  appropriate campus entity makes me aware of your needs. You are welcome to discuss the specifics with
                  me
                  but
                  absolutely not required to do so. I take your privacy and personal integrity seriously, in this area
                  and
                  all
                  others.</p>
               <br>
               <h3>Counseling & Psychological Services</h3>

               <p>CAPS is strongly committed to addressing the mental health needs of a diverse student body through
                  timely
                  access to consultation and connection to clinically appropriate services, whether for short or
                  long-term
                  needs. Visit their website at <a href="https://caps.unc.edu/">https://caps.unc.edu/</a> or stop by
                  their facilities on the third floor of the
                  Campus Health Services building for a walk-in evaluation to learn more.</p>

               <br>
               <h3>Honor code</h3>

               <p>Every time you turn in an assignment at this University, you implicitly agree—whether or not you sign
                  anything—that you have neither given nor received unauthorized aid, that the work you present is your
                  own,
                  and that you’ve properly cited and attributed all source materials.</p>


               <p>Plagiarism is an especially serious breach of UNC’s Honor Code and of your own intellectual and
                  personal
                  integrity. It includes any use of another’s words, ideas, or research—whether quoted, paraphrased, or
                  mentioned—without proper and full citation and attribution. This applies to materials taken from any
                  source,
                  online or off, including code.</p>

               <p>Note that assignment/exam submissions containing code fully or primarily authored by someone else will
                  also
                  be considered plagiarism, even if that code was offered freely by its author for use and re-use, and
                  even
                  if
                  you cite your source. The code you write in this class must be primarily your own original work. More
                  details on how much code you’re permitted to borrow in this class (and why) are available <a
                     href="borrowing.html">here</a></p>.


               <p>Please also note that although collaboration with other COMP 126 students may be permitted on certain
                  assignments, it is absolutely prohibited on any aspect of any quiz or exam.</p>


               <p>If you do not understand the definitions of plagiarism, citation, attribution, or “unauthorized aid”,
                  it
                  is
                  your responsibility to remedy that; ignorance will not be accepted as an excuse. UNC Libraries'
                  plagiarism
                  tutorial is a good place to start: <a
                     href="https://guides.lib.unc.edu/plagiarism/purpose">https://guides.lib.unc.edu/plagiarism/purpose</a>
               </p>
               <p>Please feel free to
                  contact
                  me with any questions or for additional clarification.</p>

               <p>Because it is neither my responsibility nor my place to determine whether breaches of the Honor Code
                  are
                  intentional or unintentional, I will immediately report all suspected violations to the Honor Court,
                  which
                  may result in a failing grade, probation, suspension, or expulsion.</p>
               <br>

               <h3>Disclaimer</h3>

               <p>I reserve the right to make changes to the syllabus and schedule of this course. I'll announce any
                  changes
                  as early as possible and will revise the online course schedule accordingly.</p>

               <p>In our final project of the semester, we’ll experiment with the client-driven web development model.
               </p>

               <p>In teams of 1-4 people (the project was designed as a team project, but if you strongly prefer, you
                  may
                  work alone), you will operate as a web design and development team hired to build a site for a client.
                  I
                  encourage you to find a "real" client for a "real" project among yourselves or in the community: an
                  individual, group, club, company, whatever. The important thing is to have a way to define a client's
                  needs, goals, and priorities for the design and build of the site, so why not offer your web
                  development
                  services to a group in need? (There's no requirement that your client adopt the site formally, but
                  many
                  past clients have been pleased enough with the final project that they've decided to do so.)</p>

               <p>The project will proceed through two steps: a design brief with prototype, and the website or app
                  itself.
                  Deadlines are available on Sakai.</p>

               <p>Please read the following materials carefully:</p>

               <h3>Project Design Brief & Prototype</h3>

               <p>Please submit a single PDF containing the following items:</p>

               <ul class="list">
                  <li class="list-item">A couple of paragraphs introducing your plan for the look and feel of your site.
                     What kind of tone do you want your site to convey? Friendly? Modern? Professional? Classic?
                     Upscale?
                     Cutting-edge? High-tech? Elite? Powerful? Artistic? Eclectic? Edgy? Youthful (though not childish)?
                     How will the look and feel accomplish this?</li>
                  <li class="list-item">A design palette: a description of your color scheme (with color thumbnails);
                     font
                     choices for each category (h1, h2, h3, a, p, etc., with examples); examples of primary and
                     secondary
                     buttons; examples of  mouseover/hover/active/focus states; and examples of any other relevant UI
                     components: menus, form fields, modals, etc.</li>
                  <li class="list-item">At least one sample user story with corresponding user flow diagram/s, low-fi
                     wireframe/s, and high-fi mockup/s. User flow diagrams and low-fi wireframes may be electronic or
                     hand-drawn; if hand-drawn, they must be clean, clear, and legible. High-fi mockups should be
                     created
                     with a prototyping tool like AdobeXD (which we'll learn about in class), Figma, or Sketch.</li>
               </ul>
               <h3>Final Project Site</h3>

               <p>Here are your requirements:</p>

               <ul class="list">
                  <li class="list-item">No project should have fewer than three pages or discrete, well-organized,
                     useful content areas.
                     What's a
                     "discrete content area"? For our purposes, this means at least enough content to fill an average
                     laptop's
                     browser window--more is okay, less not so much. These content areas can be part of one or more
                     scrollable
                     pages (as an example, note the large content areas that appear one at a time as you scroll down the
                     home
                     page of <a href="https://www.unc.edu/">https://www.unc.edu/</a>), separated into separate html
                     documents/pages, or a combination of the two.</li>
                  <li class="list-item">
                     If you're working with a group, each team member must produce at least two unique content areas, to
                     be
                     arranged and documented in advance.</li>
                  <li class="list-item">The site muse be mobile-first and fully responsive.</li>
                  <li class="list-item">You must include a navigation menu through which users can access the pages or
                     content areas within
                     the
                     project.</li>
                  <li class="list-item">Your project must be set up and organized according to the best practices we've
                     discussed in class.
                     Class
                     and ID names must be semantic and appropriate. </li>
                  <li class="list-item">All HTML and CSS must validate per W3C standards. </li>
                  <li class="list-item">You must create your project's layout with CSS grid properties, flexbox
                     properties, or a combination
                     of the
                     two.</li>
                  <li class="list-item">All text must be written by either you or your client (no borrowing filler text
                     from the Internet).
                  </li>
                  <li class="list-item">No copyright violations: images and media must come from the public domain, be
                     Creative Commons or
                     otherwise
                     licensed for reuse and sharing, or you must give credit to the original author of the media item
                     you
                     plan to
                     use.</li>
                  <li class="list-item">There should be no broken links or missing images.</li>
                  <li class="list-item">HTML5 structural-semantic elements should be used instead of generic divs when
                     appropriate, but divs
                     are
                     fine to use, too.
                     Site follows accessibility guidelines and considers the needs of users with restrictions such as
                     visual impairments or mobility restrictions, as well as anyone using via assistive technologies to
                     access the Internet: e.g., images include alt tags, all :hover pseudoclasses have corresponding
                     :focus
                     pseudoclasses, all contrast ratios pass at at least for the WCAG AA level to ensure readability
                     (you can test this with tools like <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">this
                        one</a>).</li>
                  <li class="list-item">
                     The site must be deployed live on the Internet. We'll discuss this further in class.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>A rubric will be provided.</p>

               <h3>Bootstrapping and Borrowing</h3>

               <p>As you know, I do allow some amount of code borrowing in assignments for this class. That should
                  make the development process much faster and easier for you, as long as you understand how the
                  tools work. However, there is such thing as too much. There is a point at which it becomes clear
                  that this isn't an original site with borrowed components but, for example, a website template
                  created by an advanced and skilled developer and slightly modified to pass as a student project.
                  Don't do this, please.</p>

               <p>I say more about this on the course Syllabus & Policies. Please review those guidelines carefully
                  and let me know if you have any questions.</p>

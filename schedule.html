               <h3>Introduction</h3>

               <p>Th 8/19. Brief meeting for syllabus review, SN 014.</p>

               <h3>Week 1: Setup & Basic HTML</h3>

               <p>Tu 8/24. Lecture/discussion, Zoom. Read chapters 1-4 in Duckett, HTML
                  &
                  CSS. (Don't worry, it's mostly images, and also don't worry about following along with the "creating a
                  web
                  page" sections, because we'll do that stuff together in VSCode or your preferred text editor during
                  class.)
                  Set up VSCode or another text editor before class: details at
                  <a href="https://comp126.com/setup.html" target="_blank">https://comp126.com/setup.html</a>.
                  Also recommended: Introduction, Basic Web Pages, and Links & Images sections
                  at <a
                     href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/">https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/</a>
                  (Note that these tutorials reference the Atom text
                  editor, not VSCode. The two applications work in very similar ways for this kind of project, so you're
                  welcome to use either, or whichever alternative you prefer.)</p>

               <p>Th 8/26. In-person work session, demos, examples. Focus on getting everyone's Assignment 1 project
                  directory
                  set up so you can start adding content. Maybe a bit of CSS preview before next week. In SN 014,
                  masked,
                  or
                  join via Zoom.</p>

               <h3>Week 2: Introduction to CSS: Basic Styling, the Box Model, Display</h3>

               <p>Tu 8/3. Zoom. Lecture. Read <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/"
                     target="_blank">Interneting is
                     Hard:
                     "Hello, CSS"; "The Box Model"; "CSS Selectors"</a> before class. (Don't worry about the specifics
                  of the setup they walk you through; stick to the model we've set up for A1. Just get the
                  basics of CSS syntax, box model, and display properties for now.) Highly recommended: <a
                     href="https://cssguidelin.es/#introduction" target="_blank">CSS Guidelines,</a> especially "Syntax
                  & Formatting" & "Naming Conventions".</p>

               <p>Th 9/2. SN 014. Work session, demos, examples. <b>Sakai Quiz 1 @ 12:30pm.</b></p>

               <h3>Week 3: More CSS: Layout, Positioning, Floats</h3>

               <p>Tu 9/7. Zoom class. Read <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/"
                     target="_blank">Interneting is
                     Hard:
                     "Floats" and "Advanced Positioning"</a> before class. (You can skip the Flexbox section for now.)
               </p>

               <p>Th 9/9. SN 014. Work session, demos, examples.</p>

               <p>Su 9/12. <b>Assignment 1 Due, 11:55pm EST.</b></p>

                     Web Design with HTML5 & CSS3</em> (the course textbook) ch. 1-3; and 2) watch <a

               <p>Th 9/16. Zoom-only lecture/Q&A. No in-person meeting, although you're welcome to Zoom in from SN014 if

               <p>Tu 10/12 & Th 10/14. <b>No new material.</b>
                  <p>From Tessa:<b> In addition to my regular Zoom office hours
                        (TuTh 11am-12:15pm EST at my Zoom OH link), I will offer optional Q&A/review/discussion
                        sessions on Zoom during both of this week's class times (12:30-1:45pm EST both days at our usual
                        class
                        time Zoom link). </b>Technically, of course, all classes and office hours are cancelled on
                     Tuesday, but
                     I'm planning to remain available during those times on <em>both</em> Tuesday and Thursday, just in
                     case anyone could use a little extra help or just wants to keep busy. There is absolutely no
                     pressure to show up; I only want you to know that my support is there, regardless of what you need
                     it for.</p>

                  <p>So join in as much or as little as you like with questions, to go on CSS and design
                     tangents, and/or just to chat. We'll keep it very light and hopefully enjoyable. I won't be
                     lecturing, and I won't
                     introduce any crucial new material (or if I do, I'll make sure to present it again to the whole
                     class
                     when we reconvene).</p>
                  <p>Please use this time however you need: to get caught up, explore new things, or simply
                     rest, recoup, reflect, and, I hope, begin to heal.</p>

                  <p><b>Please note:</b> Various ULA office hours may be rescheduled or cancelled this week. Updates and
                     changes
                     will be
                     posted on Piazza.</p>

                        Is UI Design? A Comprehensive Guide</a>. (Note: I assigned this article because it's a solid
                     introduction to UI basics from a reliable organization. However, please be aware that toward the
                     end of the piece, they do try briefly to sell you their UI bootcamp. That's not my aim, so please
                     feel free to ignore those pitches.)</p>
